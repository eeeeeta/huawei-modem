# huawei-modem

An in-development library for interfacing with USB 3G/HSDPA/UMTS modems (particularly Huawei ones, like the E220 and E3531 models)
that use the Hayes/AT command set.

## Status

Some basic functionality is starting to take shape - presently, the library can send and decode GSM 7-bit and UCS-2 SMSes, using the
SMS PDU format. However, everything is still in flux at this stage. As such, documentation is a bit sparse, since there's no point
documenting something that's going to change the day after you document it. This will change when things settle down...!
